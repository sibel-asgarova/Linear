# Salary Dataset Analysis

This repository provides tools for analyzing the `Salary_dataset.csv` file using two different methods: **Linear Regression** (using scikit-learn) and **Statistical Analysis** (using custom statistical methods).

## Files

- **Salary Dataset_LR.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook performing regression analysis with scikit-learn.
- **Salary Dataset_ST.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook performing regression analysis using custom statistical methods.
- **Salary_dataset.csv**: The dataset containing `YearsExperience` and `Salary` columns.
- **src/**: A folder containing supporting Python modules for the statistical analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all required dependencies for the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.
